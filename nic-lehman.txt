Stretch Questions

    The position of the element is fixed on the page
3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    you can use the max-width
4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block by defult: 
        <address> <article> <aside> <blockquote> <canvas> <dd>< div> <dl> <dt> <fieldset> <figcaption> figure> <footer> <form> <h1>-<h6> <header> <hr> <li> <main> <nav> <noscript> <ol> <p> <pre> <section> <table> <tfoot> <ul> <video>
    inline by defult: 
        <a> <abbr> <acronym> <b> <bdo> <big> <br> <button> <cite> <code> <dfn> <em> <i> <img> <input> <kbd> <label> <map> <object> <output> <q> <samp> <script> <select> <small> <span> <strong ><sub> <sup> <textarea> <time> <tt> <var>
    inline-block by defult: 
        ??? can't find any concrete info on this.  lots of conflicting info.  some say <img> acts line inline-block, same with <button> <input> <select> but W3Schools gave me the lists above and say these elements are all inline....

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    every HTML element is wrapped in a box. this box consists of the margin, border, padding and content. It is used to add borders around elements and define the space(s) between them. 
    
    The width or height we specify only applies to the content...To fix this, we need to account for the width + left/right (border,padding,margin) or height + top/bottom(border,padding,margin). 

    This is not particularly useful for responsive design.  Web pages are opened on many different devices with many diferent screen sizes. There is also a problem with child elemenets not staying within the set size of the parent box width.  

    We use the 'box-sizing' property with 'content-box' and typically 'border-box' to fix this behavior. border-box tells the browser to account for any border and padding values you specify for an elements width & height.
